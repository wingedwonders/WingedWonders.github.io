  <h2>Notable Incidents in Aviation History</h2>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/Tenerife.jpg" alt="Tenerife Disaster" class="incident-img">
    <h3>Tenerife Airport Disaster (1977)</h3>
    <p>The deadliest accident in aviation history occurred when two Boeing 747s collided on the runway at Los Rodeos Airport in Tenerife. Due to dense fog and radio miscommunication, the KLM aircraft initiated takeoff while the Pan Am jet was still taxiing on the same runway. The result was a catastrophic ground collision that claimed 583 lives.</p>
    <p>This incident forever changed cockpit communication. Standard phraseology and “sterile cockpit” procedures were introduced to prevent similar tragedies. It remains a case study in communication, human error, and system design failure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/JAL123.jpg" alt="Japan Airlines 123" class="incident-img">
    <h3>Japan Airlines Flight 123 (1985)</h3>
    <p>This tragic flight was the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history. A faulty repair to the aircraft's rear pressure bulkhead failed after takeoff from Tokyo, causing explosive decompression. The pilots lost control, and the Boeing 747SR crashed into Mount Takamagahara, killing 520 people.</p>
    <p>The lone survivors—just four—were seated in the rear. The accident led to global reviews of structural repairs and better training in emergency decompression. The pilot's last efforts to stabilize the aircraft were later praised as heroic.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/MH370.jpg" alt="Malaysia Airlines MH370" class="incident-img">
    <h3>Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 (2014)</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the most mysterious disappearance in modern aviation, MH370 vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The Boeing 777 is believed to have veered off course and crashed in the Indian Ocean, but its wreckage has never been fully found.</p>
    <p>This incident sparked a global search and led to major changes in aircraft tracking, including real-time satellite position reporting. The lack of a known cause remains one of aviation’s great unsolved mysteries.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/AF447.jpg" alt="Air France 447" class="incident-img">
    <h3>Air France Flight 447 (2009)</h3>
    <p>During a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, this Airbus A330 encountered turbulence and pitot tube icing, which caused the autopilot to disconnect. The pilots received faulty speed readings and ultimately stalled the aircraft due to confusion about the data. All 228 passengers and crew died.</p>
    <p>The incident revealed weaknesses in manual flying skills and cockpit hierarchy. It led to improved pilot training on stall recognition and greater emphasis on human-machine interaction.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/US1549.jpg" alt="US Airways Hudson" class="incident-img">
    <h3>US Airways Flight 1549 (2009)</h3>
    <p>This Airbus A320 was struck by a flock of geese shortly after takeoff from New York's LaGuardia Airport. Both engines failed, and Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger safely glided the plane into the Hudson River, saving all 155 aboard. It was called the “Miracle on the Hudson.”</p>
    <p>The event highlighted the importance of simulator training and calm leadership in emergencies. Sully became a national hero, and bird-strike awareness was further prioritized by regulators.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/Helios522.jpg" alt="Helios Airways Flight 522" class="incident-img">
    <h3>Helios Airways Flight 522 (2005)</h3>
    <p>This Boeing 737 took off from Cyprus but failed to pressurize properly. The crew became incapacitated due to hypoxia while the plane continued on autopilot. It eventually crashed near Athens after running out of fuel. All 121 onboard were killed.</p>
    <p>The eerie image of a ghost plane circling uncontrolled stunned the world. This incident led to increased focus on cockpit warning systems and pilot monitoring procedures to ensure cabin pressurization is not overlooked.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/TWA800.jpg" alt="TWA Flight 800" class="incident-img">
    <h3>TWA Flight 800 (1996)</h3>
    <p>A Boeing 747 exploded mid-air off the coast of Long Island, just 12 minutes after takeoff. After years of speculation and investigation, it was concluded that a spark inside the center fuel tank caused the blast. All 230 people aboard were killed.</p>
    <p>This incident sparked conspiracy theories but also real improvements. Fuel tank inerting systems became mandatory on large aircraft, reducing the risk of similar events in the future.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/Ethiopian302.jpg" alt="Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302" class="incident-img">
    <h3>Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (2019)</h3>
    <p>This Boeing 737 MAX crashed six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. It was the second deadly crash involving the MAX series, following Lion Air 610 months earlier. Investigations blamed the MCAS software system.</p>
    <p>The 737 MAX was grounded globally for over 20 months. This marked a turning point in public trust in automation, and software safety became a key regulatory focus worldwide.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/Delta191.jpg" alt="Delta Air Lines Flight 191" class="incident-img">
    <h3>Delta Air Lines Flight 191 (1985)</h3>
    <p>During landing at Dallas/Fort Worth, the Lockheed L-1011 entered a microburst and lost lift. The aircraft struck a highway and burst into flames. 137 people lost their lives, and a driver on the ground was also killed.</p>
    <p>This crash led to the widespread installation of Doppler radar and wind shear detection systems at major airports, transforming weather awareness in aviation safety.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/BA009.jpg" alt="British Airways Flight 009" class="incident-img">
    <h3>British Airways Flight 009 (1982)</h3>
    <p>This Boeing 747 flew through volcanic ash over Indonesia, causing all four engines to fail mid-flight. Remarkably, the crew managed to glide the aircraft and restart the engines once clear of the ash, landing safely in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>The incident brought global attention to volcanic ash hazards. It inspired new regulations for airspace monitoring and aircraft avoidance of volcanic plumes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/AirIndia182.jpg" alt="Air India Flight 182" class="incident-img">
    <h3>Air India Flight 182 (1985)</h3>
    <p>En route from Montreal to Delhi, a bomb exploded aboard the Boeing 747 over the Atlantic near Ireland. All 329 passengers and crew were killed, making it the deadliest act of aviation terrorism before 9/11.</p>
    <p>This led to sweeping security overhauls in passenger screening and baggage matching. It also highlighted the danger of unchecked cargo and international security coordination gaps.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <img src="img/Avianca52.jpg" alt="Avianca Flight 52" class="incident-img">
    <h3>Avianca Flight 52 (1990)</h3>
    <p>This flight from Colombia to New York ran out of fuel after delays and holding patterns. Miscommunication about the emergency situation led to air traffic controllers not prioritizing the flight. The aircraft crashed, killing 73 of 158 people on board.</p>
    <p>The crash led to improvements in how pilots declare fuel emergencies and how air traffic control handles ambiguous language in emergencies.</p>
